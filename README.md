I created two files
1) fetch_env_variable - The code in this file will fetch the environment variables.
2) fetch_network_interface - The code in this file will fetch the IP add, MAC add and interface name.

GITHUB repo - https://github.com/vishwas-devops/NBS_Project_Screening.git

Note - I do not code in Go lang so I took all the help from google. This one is not in my skill set.
